## [1. Time Series Analysis and Forecasting](https://github.com/SandKrish/TimeSeries/blob/04a426f57432cfca6e5a2d61d490e6ba7b293003/time-series-analysis-and-forecasting.ipynb)
This notebook contains detailed analysis and visualisation of water of Lake Bilancino. 
This notebook handles
* Missing value
* Resampling
* Statistical analysis
* ETS decompostion
* Simple Moving Average and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average
* Plotting time series with .rolling()
* ADF Test, Autocorrelation, Autocorrelation, ACF and PACF plots

Prediction:
* ARIMA used to analysis and predict values.
* XGBRegressor used to analysis and predict unseen future values.


## [Simple Moving Average and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average](https://github.com/SandKrish/TimeSeries/blob/04a426f57432cfca6e5a2d61d490e6ba7b293003/SMA_EWMA.ipynb)
This notebook covers various visualisation for Simple Moving Average and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average.
Can read more about explanation of same in my medium blog [here](https://medium.com/codex/simple-moving-average-and-exponentially-weighted-moving-average-with-pandas-57d4a457d363).
